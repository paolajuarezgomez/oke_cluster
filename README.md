**2.** Change the **KEYS values** for the respective **OCIDs** in oke_cluster/oke/oke.tf file 
Example for deploy the Preprod OKE cluster:
 
  * **compartment_id** = "\<CMP-LZP-PLATFORM-PREPROD-KEY>"

  * **vcn_id**="\<VCN-PREPROD-KEY>"

  * **network_compartment_id** = "\<CMP-LZP-PP-NETWORK-KEY>"

  * **subnets** = {
  cp       = { id = "\<SN-PP-CP-KEY>" }
  int_lb   = { id = "\<SN-PP-PRIV-LB-KEY>" }
  workers  = { id = "\<SN-PP-WORKERS-KEY>" }
  pods     = { id = "\<SN-PP-PODS-KEY>"}
  }

  * **nsgs** = {
  cp       = { id = "\<NSG-PREPROD-CP-KEY>" }
  int_lb   = { id = "\<NSG-PREPROD-PRIV-LB-KEY>" }
  workers  = { id = "\<NSG-PREPROD-WORKERS-KEY>" }
  pods     = { id = "\<NSG-PREPROD-PODS-KEY>" }
  }
